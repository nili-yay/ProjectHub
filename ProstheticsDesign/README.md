# 🦾 Prosthetics Design Project

This project focused on designing and developing a mechanical prosthetic limb prototype with an emphasis on **affordability**, **functionality**, and **user comfort**. Our goal was to create a device that would be low-cost and easily manufacturable, while maintaining ergonomic performance.

The design was submitted to the **2024 Canadian Society for Mechanical Engineering (CSME) National Design Competition**, where it was awarded **First Place in the Commercial Readiness Category**.

## 🔧 Objectives
- Design a functional upper-limb prosthetic using accessible materials and methods
- Prioritize ergonomic fit, ease of use, and modular assembly
- Apply engineering design principles to a real-world biomedical challenge

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods
- **CAD Modeling**: Designed and drafted 3D models using **SolidWorks** to develop prosthetic components including enclosures, sockets, and attachment mechanisms
- **Prototyping**: Led **3D printing and mechanical assembly** of prototypes to enable rapid iteration and real-world testing
- **Testing**: Conducted **iterative functional testing** and electrical integration of vibrotactile units to ensure proper sensing and feedback
- **Documentation**: Contributed to the **summary report**, created visual renderings, and supported the final presentation/demo for external review
