# 🏥 Palliative Care Clinic Simulation (Simul8)

This project models and simulates a **palliative care outpatient clinic** using **Simul8**, addressing projected increases in patient volume and resource constraints. I built a realistic and adaptable model to inform decisions on clinic workflows, staffing, and patient throughput.

## 📌 Project Context

> _"Given a rising number of patients projected to attend the outpatient clinic (via referrals or chemo clinics), we needed to assess whether current resources could handle the increased demand."_  
To answer this, I built a **discrete event simulation** using Simul8 to mirror the patient journey and clinic operations — from referrals, nurse triage, physician consultation, to discharge or end-of-year transitions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Simulate patient flow across a palliative outpatient clinic.
- Model resource constraints: **nurses, secretaries, physicians** with scheduled availability.
- Evaluate clinic's capacity to handle **projected rise** in patients.
- Optimize workflow based on real-world staff input.
- Implement return loops for patients who re-enter the system during the year.

## 🔍 Methodology

### 🧑‍⚕️ Real-World Shadowing

- Shadowed **nurses** and **secretaries** to deeply understand their roles and daily tasks.
- Designed a **Microsoft Form** to help the nurse track day-to-day activities and identify bottlenecks.
- Regularly matched simulation schedule with staff real-life workflow for accuracy and validation.
- Delivered daily workflow improvement suggestions in collaboration with clinical staff.

### 🛠 Simulation Features

- Patients enter via **referrals** or **chemo clinic** pathways.
- Triaged by nurse → seen by physician → potential discharge or reentry.
- Included **loops for returning patients** and annual resets.
- Programmed custom Simul8 **Visual Logic macros** for advanced routing and logic.

> _Simulation was designed on an **annual run cycle**, allowing us to forecast outcomes and resource utilization for a full year at a time._

### 💡 Workflow Improvements

- Provided **tech coaching** to a nurse who struggled with digital functions (copy/paste, file transfers) — significantly improved efficiency.
- Used nurse feedback to make simulation adjustments and better reflect care pathways.

## 💬 Software & Setup

- Advocated for a **Simul8 software upgrade** when the current version fell short.
- Negotiated a **price reduction** by highlighting long-term customer history.
- Requested **on-site support** to ensure smooth transition.
- Personally handled **software installation and environment setup** to meet team needs.

---

## 🎓 Learning & Development

- Proactively attended **Simul8 webinars** to master Visual Logic scripting.
- Built custom routines for:
  - Patients returning within a year.
  - Cyclical loops between nurse and physician visits.
  - Defining simulation endpoints (e.g. patient death or year rollover).

## ✅ Outcomes

- Verified that **projected rise in patients** would **exceed capacity** under current resource schedules.
- Highlighted areas for process improvements and staffing adjustments.
- Fostered stronger communication between clinical and technical teams.
- Provided a repeatable framework for other clinics using Simul8.

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

- Huge thanks to the nursing and admin staff for their time and collaboration.
- Special shoutout to the nurse who helped shape the data collection process.
