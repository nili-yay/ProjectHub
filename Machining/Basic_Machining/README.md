# Machining Project ‚Äì Aluminum Piston Assembly

This project showcases hands-on machining experience through the fabrication of a small aluminum piston and crankshaft assembly, completed as part of the MIE Machine Shop Access course at the University of Toronto.

## üîß Project Overview

Using manual machining tools including the **lathe**, **mill**, and **drill press**, I manufactured and assembled a working model of a piston-crank mechanism. The components were machined from aluminum stock and assembled using fasteners to demonstrate rotational motion transfer.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Gained
- Lathe operations (facing, turning, parting, grooving)
- Milling and precision drilling
- Tapping and countersinking
- Assembly alignment and quality checking
- Workshop safety and tool setup procedures

## üìç Context

Completion of this project was required to gain certified access to the MIE Machine Shop (MC78). It demonstrates fundamental machining techniques and mechanical assembly skills valuable in both prototyping and mechanical design contexts.
