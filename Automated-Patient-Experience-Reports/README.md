# 📞 Vocantas Patient Follow-Up Automation (Excel VBA)

This project automated the **monthly reporting** of patient feedback from a third-party automated call system (Vocantas). The solution eliminated hours of manual data cleaning and processing — built entirely with native Excel tools due to strict hospital IT policies.

## 📌 Project Summary

Patients would receive treatment, leave, and later receive an **automated follow-up call** surveying their experience (e.g. “Were you helped promptly?”, “Did you encounter issues?”).

The **third-party vendor** returned results as unstructured, text-heavy `.txt` files. My manager tasked me with **manually compiling** results for monthly executive reports — but I saw a better way.

## ⚡ My Solution

- **Identified a Pattern** in the raw text data that could be parsed and categorized.
- **Avoided External Tools**: No Python or external installs allowed due to hospital IT security.
- Decided to build the solution using **Excel Macros (VBA)** — a tool already installed.
- Taught myself macros from scratch (Stack Overflow, YouTube) and reverse-engineered examples.
