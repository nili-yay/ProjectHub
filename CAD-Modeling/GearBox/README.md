## ⚙️ Right-Angle Gearbox – CAD Assembly

This project demonstrates a compact right-angle gearbox designed using SolidWorks, featuring a 90° input-output configuration with vertical shaft offset. The assembly was created as part of a group design project to explore mechanical power transmission principles and 3D-printable gear design.

### 🔩 Design Overview
- The **input** and **output** shafts are oriented at **90°** to each other.
- **Shafts (6) and (7)** are **parallel but vertically offset** (not collinear).
- Two gear pairs are used:
  - 🛞 **Bevel Gear Pair (1:1 ratio)**: for the 90° power transfer.
  - ⚙️ **Spur Gear Pair (3:1 ratio)**: for speed reduction.

### 🧠 Design Decisions
- **Straight-tooth bevel gears** were selected for ease of 3D printing and low-speed, low-torque operation.
- **Gear 2 & 3**: 20-tooth bevel gears, 12 diametral pitch.
- **Gear 4 & 5**: Spur gear pair with 20 and 60 teeth respectively to achieve a **3:1 speed reduction**.
- Spur gears use a **20° pressure angle** and a **20 DP** for printability and compact housing design.
