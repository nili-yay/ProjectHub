# 3D Modeling Projects – CAD Portfolio

This repository highlights a selection of 3D models and mechanical assemblies created using **SolidWorks** during my engineering education. These projects were completed as part of coursework and group-based design assignments, and are included here to demonstrate my proficiency with CAD modeling and assembly design.

## 🔧 Jigsaw Mechanism – CAD Assembly

This model represents a simplified **jigsaw mechanism**, designed to illustrate rotary-to-linear motion conversion — a common principle used in reciprocating power tools.

### ⚙️ How It Works
- A rotating gear drives a slotted disc.
- A pin within the disc’s slot converts rotary motion into linear reciprocation.
- The central arm oscillates, simulating the motion of a jigsaw blade.
