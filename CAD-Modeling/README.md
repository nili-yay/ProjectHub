# 3D Modeling Projects â€“ CAD Portfolio

This repository highlights a selection of 3D models and mechanical assemblies created using **SolidWorks** during my engineering education. These projects were completed as part of coursework and group-based design assignments, and are included here to demonstrate my proficiency with CAD modeling and assembly design.
