# Custom Ultrasound Transducer Mount ‚Äì CAD Contribution

## üìù Project Summary

This repository contains the CAD design and iterations for a custom 3D-printed ultrasound transducer holder developed for the research study:

**"The Effects of Muscle Co-Contraction on Ankle Joint Muscle Stiffness in Maintaining Postural Steadiness using Ultrasound Elastography in Healthy Individuals"**

This work was presented at the **Toronto Biomedical Conference (ToBE)**.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Role

I assisted in modeling the CAD file for the transducer mount, as the lead author required CAD support for their experimental setup. My contributions included:

- Designing the **initial CAD model** from scratch.
- Iterating through **three design versions** based on feedback.
- Key improvements:
  - Added **fillets** to remove sharp edges (per feedback).
  - Adjusted **dimensions** for better fit and stability.
- Preparing the files for **3D printing**, which was followed by **physical testing**.

## üìÅ Files Included

- üß± [Initial Design (V1) ‚Äì STL File](https://github.com/nili-yay/ProjectHub/blob/main/CAD-Modeling/Custom%20Ultrasound%20Transducer%20Mount/First_Iteration.STL)  
- üß± [Final Design (V3) ‚Äì STL File](https://github.com/nili-yay/ProjectHub/blob/main/CAD-Modeling/Custom%20Ultrasound%20Transducer%20Mount/Final.stl)  
- üìÑ [Conference Poster (PDF)](https://github.com/nili-yay/ProjectHub/blob/main/CAD-Modeling/Custom%20Ultrasound%20Transducer%20Mount/Toronto_Biomedical_Conference_Poster_ToBE.pdf)

> ‚úÖ Make sure to use a slicing tool (e.g. Cura, PrusaSlicer) to prepare these STL files for 3D printing.

## üîÅ Design Iteration Summary

| Version | Changes Made            | Notes                                |
|---------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| V1      | Basic shape, no fillets | Initial prototype                     |
| V2      | Added fillets           | Improved ergonomics, reduced edges   |
| V3      | Adjusted dimensions     | Final version used for 3D printing   |

## üñ®Ô∏è 3D Printing & Testing

The final design was exported as an STL file and 3D printed. It was physically tested and confirmed to minimize transducer motion during ultrasound data collection.
