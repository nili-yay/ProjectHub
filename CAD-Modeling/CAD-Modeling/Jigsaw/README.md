## 🔧 Jigsaw Mechanism – CAD Assembly

This model represents a simplified **jigsaw mechanism**, designed to illustrate rotary-to-linear motion conversion — a common principle used in reciprocating power tools.

### ⚙️ How It Works
- A rotating gear drives a slotted disc.
- A pin within the disc’s slot converts rotary motion into linear reciprocation.
- The central arm oscillates, simulating the motion of a jigsaw blade.
